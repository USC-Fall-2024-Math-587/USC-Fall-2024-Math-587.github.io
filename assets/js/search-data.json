Each day is a small step forward. When we turn around at the end of the course, only then, do we see how far we have truly traveled. For more of my pedagogical philosophy and experience, take a look at the teaching page. As an extension of teaching, I take pride in mentoring researchers at any stage. In my research, I study algebraic geometry and am particularly interested in questions arising from Homological Mirror Symmetry. Much of my current work focuses on derived categories and their relation to more classical questions. My research has been partially supported by the Simons Foundation and the National Science Foundation. It has also benefited from a membership at the Institute for Advanced Study, a Research Professorship at Simons-Laufer Mathematical Sciences Institute, funding from USC, and the Southeastern Conference.

    "content": "Unexcused Absences . In traditional lecture-based, in-person courses, students are allowed to miss 5% of the total class meeting time, regardless of the reason. In general, this “5% rule” means that students won’t be penalized for missing two sessions of a 50-minute MWF course or one session of a 75-minute TR course. Online, lab, clinical, practicum and certain other courses may allow fewer absences. Example Reasons for Unexcused Absences . | Illness without a doctor’s note | Routine doctor’s appointments | Friend or family events such as weddings and vacations | Car trouble | Work obligations | . Excused Absences . In certain cases, students who miss class will be given excused absences. Students won’t be penalized for these absences, and they’ll be offered the opportunity to make up missed work or complete an alternate assignment. Instructors may require make-up work to be completed within one week of returning to class. Example Reasons for Excused Absences . | Military duty or jury duty | Observance of a religious practice, holiday or holy day | Illness or injury too severe or contagious to attend class, with appropriate documentation | Death or severe illness of immediate family member, with appropriate documentation | . Request an Excused Absence . Follow these steps to help us process your request as quickly as possible. | Check whether your absence may be excused. | Review the appropriate attendance policy — undergraduate or graduate — and the guidelines below to determine whether your absence may be excused and what type of documentation is required. | Submit your complete request as soon as reasonably possible. Submit your complete request — including appropriate documentation — as soon as possible, but no later than 30 days following the absence, or by the last day of class for the semester, whichever is sooner. -For absences that are known at the beginning of the semester (such as religious holidays or authorized university activities), students should submit their requests no later than the second week of class. | Requests for excused absences that occur during final exams should be submitted within 72 hours of the scheduled exam time. | Be aware of possible exceptions. | Instructors may refuse to give an excused absence or make-up work that would result in a fundamental alteration of the essential academic requirements of the course. In some of these cases, you may want to consider dropping a course. Undergraduate students can review information on the hardship withdrawal webpage. Graduate students should review their academic bulletin. | . ",

Because the university classroom is a place designed for the free exchange of ideas, we must show respect for one another in all circumstances. We will show respect for one another by exhibiting patience and courtesy in our exchanges. Appropriate language and restraint from verbal attacks upon those whose perspectives differ from your own is a minimum requirement. Courtesy and kindness is the norm for those who participate in the class. Mistakes, in particular during the running phase, are expected and natural. Mistakes are how learning happens. All students should recognize and respect the bravery of a student presenting a proof or solution. If you ever feel uncomfortable beyond the intellectual challenge of the course, please contact me. Teams is a way for you to share your ideas and learning with your colleagues in this class. We do this as colleagues in learning, and the online space is meant to be a safe and respectful environment for us to conduct these discussions. Some general netiquette rules: . | Treat one another with respect. It will be expected that we will not attack one another personally for holding different opinions. | Do not use all CAPITAL LETTERS in emails or discussion board postings. This is considered “shouting” and is seen as impolite or aggressive. | Begin emails with a proper salutation (Examples: Dr. Name; Ms. Name; Hello Professor Name; Good afternoon Mr. Name). Starting an email without a salutation or a simple “Hey” is not appropriate. | When sending an email, please include a detailed subject line. Additionally, make sure you reference the course number (Ex. ENGL 287) in the message and sign the mail with your name. | Use proper grammar, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Text messaging language is not acceptable. | Use good taste when communicating. Profanity should be avoided. | Re-Read, think, and edit your message before you click “Send/Submit/Post.” . | Please remember when posting to be respectful and courteous to your colleagues, and limit your communication to topics of this course and the assignments. | .
